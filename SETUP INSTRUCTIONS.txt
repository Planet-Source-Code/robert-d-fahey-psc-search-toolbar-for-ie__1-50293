**************************************************************
In NO WAY am I taking credit for this project.  I found 
it on this man's site : Eduardo Morcillo, he is the creator
of it as far as I know.  What I did was remove some of 
the buttons he had and made it into a search bar for
Planet Source Code.  I made a few changes to the code
and added  some of my own things, but the majority
of this code was written by the man above.

=======================================
SETUP
=======================================

BE SURE ALL INSTANCES OF IE ARE CLOSED BEFORE STARTING THIS.

I did not include the .DLL file mainly because PSC would have removed it anyhow, so you will need to do the following:

1.) Unzip the project to a directory.  Create a SUB Directory in that folder called Bin or Compatibility.
2.) Open the project and choose File, Make psctb.dll.
3.) Save this file in the BIN or Compatibility SUB FOLDER that we created above.

What that will do is always reference the original .DLL for compatibility.  If you start messing with the project and make
some changes that will reflect the interface (Object interface, not the actual GUI), then it will break the compatibility and create
a new classid, which we don't want.

4.) Now click File, Make psctb.dll again, this time saving it to any location on your computer (I usually save it in the same folder 
as the project, not the BIN or Compatibility folder).
5.) The next thing is to set the Project Compatibility mode.....do this by choosing Project, then Properties.  A dialog box will appear, choose
the Component Tab, then under the Version Compatibility section, choose BINARY COMPATIBILITY and then browse and locate the .DLL that
we created in the BIN or Compatibility folder in step 3.
6.) Now register the DLL using the RUN command (I.E. Start, Run, then type:  regsvr32 "D:\VB\IE Bands\ExplorerBands\PSC Toolbar\psctb.dll"
But replace the above path to where you saved the DLL for the 2nd time (not the dll in the bin or compatibility subfolder).

Now this part is a little tricky, but it's easy if you follow the steps:

6.) Run the project in VB, you will notice nothing happens, you will have to open your regsirty (using RegEdit from the Run menu), then do a search 
from the TOP of the registry (Be sure My Computer is highlighted) then do a search (Find) for PSCToolbar.  You should get alot of matches, you want
to look for the PSCToolbar.Toolbar Folder and the Clsid subfolder inside there.  If you click on that folder, you will notice the key appear on the right,
this is the Class ID (CLSID) for the toolbar object.  Copy this to notepad.

7.) Now you have to install this as a registry key somewhere else in the registry.  To save time, just copy the following code into notepad and REPLACE
the existing ClassID with the one you found in your registry:



Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Toolbar]
"{YOUR CLASSID BETWEEN THESE BRACES}"="PSC Toolbar"




BE SURE TO COPY IT EXACTLY and then save the file with a .reg extension to it.

8.) Once that is done, close the file (if you haven't already) then double click on it.  Windows should ask you if you want to add the information to the 
Registry, say YES.  It should then confirm the addition of the registry key.

9.) Open IE, right click on the toolbar and choose Planet Source Code and that's it!

Now this version currently only searches the VB section of PSC, but I am working on a new version that will allow you to change that to whichever
language you wish.

Comments/Suggestions are always welcome.
