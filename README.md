## PSC Search Toolbar for IE


</div>

### Description

This places a Toolbar on IE and allows you to search the VB section of PSC for articles and such. A great way to save time!! This is only version 1, I am working on a new version that will include an options button and a button for each language in PSC to search from.
 
### More Info
 
Please read and follow the SetupInstructions.txt in the .zip file. It explains how to setup everything.

This code was NOT created by me. I found it online from a man named:

' Author: Eduardo Morcillo

' E-Mail: edanmo@geocities.com

' Web Page: http://www.domaindlx.com/e_morcillo

I simply took his version, changed the way it looks, feels, and reacts, then applied changes necessary to suit my needs.

Program will not appear correct if just ran from within VB. The Redraw mode does not draw the bitmaps correctly, but this goes away when running on the stand-alone dll.
